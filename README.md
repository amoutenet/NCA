# NCA

Hello !

This is the source code for an impurity solver based on the Non-Crossing Approximation, as part of the TRIQS project: https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs. It requires the 2.1.x version.

This project was achieved together with Francesco Peronaci, Antoine Georges, Michel Ferrero and Olivier Parcollet. Details are available in my PhD manuscript: https://theses.fr/2020IPPAX026
Three different branches are available:
 - the full out-of-equilibrium solver (master), where the use of the solve equilibrium method can be specified
 - the two-branch method based on Keldysh formalism (two_branches)
 - the steady-state method (ness) that uses the long-time limit of the equations

This code was developed during my PhD under the supervision of Antoine Georges and Michel Ferrero, at Coll√®ge de France (Paris), Ecole polytechnique (Palaiseau) and Flatiron Institute (New York). Note that the code is not maintained anymore.
